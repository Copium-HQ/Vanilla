            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p>
                In the current time and era it is only a matter of time before an alien contagion may
                put our regular<br></br> lives at risk and threaten all of humanity. As such, this document
                was created with close communication<br></br> with all of Earth's governments in order to
                safe guard humanity in the event the above occurs. This<br></br> document will outline the 
                protocols in place in regards to the biosecurity of our own race and what<br></br> actions we 
                will take to ensure the longevity and health of our own race. We understand the need
                 to<br></br> communicate with aliens, but humanity will not take a risk it does not need to.
